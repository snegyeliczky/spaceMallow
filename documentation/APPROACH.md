## Comments Whilst Developing

1. I spent time to understand the  spaceX API because it was new to me, than used postman to find the right endpoints for my needs. Than implemented in the api and point. I also spend some time to understand the RTK Query with the linked tutorial 
2. Find a typesript and styled component friendly ui library AntDesign. I used it in my previous project, but it has very good documentation easy to use and fits good with React.
